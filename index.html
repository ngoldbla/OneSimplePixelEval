    <h1>OneSimplePixel Project Archaeological Report</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This report presents the findings of a digital archaeological investigation into the OneSimplePixel project, a web-based collaborative pixel art experiment created in 2006-2007. The analysis examines the project's technical implementation, user experience design, development timeline, and philosophical underpinnings.

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>This archaeological investigation applied the following approaches:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Artifact Examination</strong>: Analyzing preserved files, code, and digital assets</li>
<li><strong>Technical Reconstruction</strong>: Understanding the system architecture and functionality</li>
<li><strong>Timeline Analysis</strong>: Establishing chronology through file dates and version indicators</li>
<li><strong>Interface Archaeology</strong>: Reconstructing user experience from design files and code</li>
<li><strong>Contextual Placement</strong>: Situating the project within web history and digital art evolution</li>
</ol>

<h2>Key Artifacts</h2>

<p>Key artifacts that informed this analysis include:
</p>

<ul><li>Database schema and SQL dumps</li>
  <li>PHP code for pixel image generation</li>
  <li>Interface design files and mockups</li>
  <li>JavaScript interaction code</li>
  <li>HTML templates and web pages</li>
  <li>Excel spreadsheets tracking pixel data</li>
  <li>Image files showing the project's visual evolution</li>
</ul>

<h2>About This Archaeological Report</h2>

<p>This report was generated using forensic digital archaeology techniques to examine and contextualize the OneSimplePixel project. The goal was to reconstruct not only the technical implementation but also the conceptual thinking, design process, and user experience that characterized this early collaborative web art experiment.
</p><p>The archive represents a valuable snapshot of web development practices, interface design approaches, and philosophical explorations of digital participation from the mid-2000s.</p>
