# OneSimplePixel: Archaeological Conclusions

## Project Summary

OneSimplePixel was a collaborative web art experiment created by the design company "onesimple" in late 2006 and launched on January 1, 2007. The project invited participants to claim individual pixels from a 1000u00d71000 canvas, assign them colors, names, and personal meanings, and collectively create an emergent, collaborative artwork.

Unlike commercial million-pixel sites that were popular during this period, OneSimplePixel positioned itself as a philosophical exploration of collective creation, raising questions about patterns, meaning, and collaborative expression.

## Key Findings from Archaeological Analysis

### 1. Technical Implementation

The project was built using standard web technologies of the mid-2000s:

- LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- JavaScript for interactive elements
- PHP GD library for image generation
- MySQL database for storing pixel data

The technical architecture balanced several constraints:

- Managing a potentially large dataset (up to 1 million pixels)
- Creating an interactive experience with mid-2000s web technologies
- Generating and displaying the composite image efficiently
- Facilitating user participation through an intuitive interface

### 2. Development Process

The archaeological evidence shows a methodical development process:

- **Rapid Development**: From concept (October 2006) to launch (January 2007) in approximately two months
- **Iterative Design**: Multiple rounds of interface refinements documented in design files
- **Parallel Environments**: Separate beta and production environments maintained
- **Version Control**: SVN used for design files, indicating professional development practices
- **Regular Backups**: Multiple database dumps and pixel tracking spreadsheets show ongoing maintenance

### 3. User Experience Design

The project featured a sophisticated user experience for its time:

- Multi-level zoom interface for navigating the pixel canvas
- Contextual information display for pixel viewing
- Structured form for pixel claiming with validation
- Country selection and personal expression capabilities
- Visual design that balanced function with philosophical purpose

### 4. Philosophical Underpinnings

The archaeological artifacts reveal a project with philosophical depth:

- Questions about collective creation explicitly stated in the About page
- Design choices that emphasized meaning over commercial interests
- Focus on personal expression through pixel descriptions 
- Equal allocation of digital space (one pixel per person)
- Archival of data that captured both visual and textual expression

### 5. Cultural Context

OneSimplePixel emerged during a specific cultural moment:

- Early Web 2.0 era of participatory web experiences
- Response to commercial pixel advertising sites
- Pre-social media exploration of online collaboration
- Early example of digital art that blended individual and collective expression
- Bridging of technological and philosophical exploration

## Archaeological Insights

### Project Lifecycle

The artifacts suggest a project lifecycle spanning at least the first quarter of 2007:

1. **Conception** (October 2006): Initial idea formation
2. **Development** (November-December 2006): Technical implementation and design
3. **Launch** (January 1, 2007): Public release and initial participation
4. **Active Phase** (January-March 2007): Ongoing participation and maintenance
5. **Documentation** (Date Unknown): Comprehensive archiving of the project

### Design Thinking

The design artifacts reveal thoughtful consideration of:

- User pathways through the experience
- Balance between accessibility and functionality
- Minimalist aesthetic that didn't compete with user contributions
- Meaningful interactions that supported the philosophical goals
- Technical constraints of the era

### Evolution of Web Art

OneSimplePixel represents an interesting moment in web-based art:

- Transition from static to interactive web experiences
- Early exploration of crowdsourced creativity
- Blend of visual and textual expression
- Democratization of artistic participation
- Documentation of both process and outcome

## Unanswered Questions

Despite thorough archaeological analysis, some questions remain:

1. **Final Outcomes**: What did the final pixel canvas look like? How many pixels were claimed?
2. **User Demographics**: Who participated in the project and from where?
3. **Project Conclusion**: Did the project have a formal end, or did it gradually wind down?
4. **Philosophical Conclusions**: Were the initial questions about collective creation answered?
5. **Creator Reflections**: How did the creators view the project's success?

## Legacy and Significance

OneSimplePixel represents an important artifact in the evolution of web-based participatory art and design:

1. **Technical Implementation**: Shows sophisticated web development for its era
2. **User Experience Design**: Demonstrates thoughtful interface design for participation
3. **Philosophical Exploration**: Uses technology to explore deeper questions about creativity and collaboration
4. **Historical Context**: Captures a moment in web culture between early static sites and later social media
5. **Documentation Practices**: Represents thorough archiving of a digital project

## Conclusion

The archaeological analysis of OneSimplePixel reveals a project that was simultaneously a technological implementation, a design experiment, a philosophical exploration, and a communal artistic creation. The preserved artifacts demonstrate professional development practices, iterative design thinking, and a thoughtful balance between technical constraints and conceptual goals.

This project stands as an interesting example of web-based participatory art from the mid-2000s, bridging the gap between individual expression and collective creation. Its detailed documentation provides valuable insights into both the technical implementation and conceptual thinking behind web projects of this era.
