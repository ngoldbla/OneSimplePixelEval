## Methodology

This archaeological investigation applied the following approaches:

1. **Artifact Examination**: Analyzing preserved files, code, and digital assets
2. **Technical Reconstruction**: Understanding the system architecture and functionality
3. **Timeline Analysis**: Establishing chronology through file dates and version indicators
4. **Interface Archaeology**: Reconstructing user experience from design files and code
5. **Contextual Placement**: Situating the project within web history and digital art evolution

## Key Artifacts

Key artifacts that informed this analysis include:

- Database schema and SQL dumps
- PHP code for pixel image generation
- Interface design files and mockups
- JavaScript interaction code
- HTML templates and web pages
- Excel spreadsheets tracking pixel data
- Image files showing the project's visual evolution

## About This Archaeological Report

This report was generated using forensic digital archaeology techniques to examine and contextualize the OneSimplePixel project. The goal was to reconstruct not only the technical implementation but also the conceptual thinking, design process, and user experience that characterized this early collaborative web art experiment.

The archive represents a valuable snapshot of web development practices, interface design approaches, and philosophical explorations of digital participation from the mid-2000s.
