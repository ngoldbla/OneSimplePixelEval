# OneSimplePixel Project Timeline

## Project Conception and Planning Phase (October-November 2006)

- **Late October 2006**: Initial concept creation begins
  - Project is conceived as a philosophical experiment in collective creation
  - Differentiation from commercial million-pixel advertising sites is established

- **November 22, 2006**: Development officially begins
  - Technical planning and architecture design
  - Initial database schema creation
  - Interface design concepts start

## Development Phase (November-December 2006)

- **Late November 2006**: 
  - Database structure defined and implemented
  - Core functionality coded
  - First interface mockups created

- **Early December 2006**: 
  - Beta environment setup
  - First working prototype of the pixel selection interface
  - First entry in Excel tracking sheet (`osp_pixels_12_01.xls` suggests December 1 date)

- **Mid-December 2006**:
  - User testing of beta version
  - Interface refinements based on feedback
  - Preparation for launch

## Launch and Initial Operation (January 2007)

- **January 1, 2007**: Official launch of OneSimplePixel
  - First pixels claimed (timestamp in database backup shows first entry on this date)
  - Public announcement and initial user engagement

- **Early January 2007**:
  - Monitoring and addressing initial technical issues
  - Refinements to pixel selection interface
  - First backups of the database created

## Refinement and Growth Phase (January-March 2007)

- **Mid-January 2007**:
  - Updated interface designs (evidenced by dated design files)
  - Additional features implemented based on user feedback
  - Growing collection of user-contributed pixels

- **February 2007**:
  - Continued operation and database maintenance
  - Further refinements to the interface
  - Backup systems established

- **March 2007**:
  - Major data checkpoint (`osp_03.25.07.xls` indicates March 25 date)
  - Database schema updates and optimizations
  - Continued collection of user pixels

## Post-Project Documentation (Timeframe Unknown)

- Creation of comprehensive backups
- Archiving of all project files, including:
  - Production code
  - Database backups
  - Design assets
  - Beta versions
  - Development documentation

## Key Artifacts and Their Timeline Significance

### Database Files

- `1mp.sql` and `1mp_new_beginning.sql`: Early database structure and initial entries
- `db_1mp_beta.sql`: Beta testing database structure

### Design Evolution

- `main_interface.xcf`: Initial interface design concepts
- `pixel_add_interface.round.02.pdf`: Second round of interface design (showing iterative process)
- `badge_interface.round.02.graffle.zip`: Additional interface components developed in parallel

### Development Progression

- Multiple backup versions of PHP scripts show the evolution of functionality
- `.svn` version control directories indicate organized development process
- Various `index.php`, `index.php_`, `index.php__` files showing iterations of the main page

### Data Tracking

- `osp_pixels.xls`: General pixel tracking spreadsheet
- `osp_pixels_12_01.xls`: Initial data tracking from December 1, 2006
- `osp_03.25.07.xls`: Data snapshot from March 25, 2007

## Project Progression Insights

The timeline artifacts reveal a methodical development process:

1. **Conceptual Phase**: Philosophical groundwork and technical planning
2. **Development Phase**: Rapid implementation from concept to beta in approximately one month
3. **Launch**: Timely debut on January 1, 2007 (symbolic new beginning)
4. **Operation**: At least three months of active maintenance and growth

The presence of multiple backup files, versioned designs, and dated spreadsheets shows ongoing attention to the project through at least the first quarter of 2007.
